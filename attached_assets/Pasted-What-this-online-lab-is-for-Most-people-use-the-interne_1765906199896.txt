What this online lab is for

Most people use the internet every day without ever seeing what’s really happening. Wi-Fi feels like “air,” websites feel like “magic,” and the home router feels like a mysterious black box that only breaks when someone has a Zoom call.

But underneath that calm surface is something very concrete:

Your home network is a collection of real devices (phones, laptops, TVs, printers, cameras, speakers) that constantly communicate.

Those devices have identities and addresses.

Some parts of your network are meant to be private (your home Wi-Fi), and some are effectively public (coffee shops, hotels, airports—even “password protected” networks if the password is posted on the wall).

A lot of security problems aren’t “Hollywood hacking.” They’re ordinary mistakes: weak Wi-Fi settings, devices left on default passwords, connecting to the wrong network, trusting a login page you shouldn’t, or assuming “the lock icon” means everything is safe.

This lab is designed to give you something most people never get:

A clear, visual mental model of how networking works—plus a realistic understanding of how things go wrong—so you can make smarter decisions.

What we’re trying to accomplish

By the end, learners should be able to:

Explain what a home network actually is
A router + a bunch of devices + the rules they use to communicate.

Understand the difference between “private” and “public” networks
Not as a vague idea, but as a set of concrete consequences.

Know what IP addresses and MAC addresses are
And what they’re used for—without memorizing jargon.

Understand what encryption does and doesn’t do
Especially the difference between HTTP vs HTTPS, and why VPNs can matter on public Wi-Fi.

Build an “instinct” for safe networking
So the right behavior becomes automatic: guest networks, IoT isolation, safer public Wi-Fi habits, avoiding credential traps, and tightening device settings.

Why this is built as a sandbox (and not “scan your real network”)

Sometimes we train people in high-security environments (including government and intelligence services). In those contexts, it’s not acceptable to have learners copy/paste real identifiers (device lists, MAC addresses, SSIDs, private IPs, public IPs) into an online tool—even if the tool is well-intentioned.

So this lab works differently:

Everything you see is fictional but realistic.

The networks are “story networks” modeled after real-world patterns.

The risks and consequences are true to life—but no one touches your actual devices.

This makes the experience zero-risk, while still being vivid, surprising, and memorable.

How the lab is structured

The lab is a set of interactive modules. Each module is like a different “lens” on the same hidden world:

One module makes the network visible.

One module makes encryption tangible.

One module tests your judgment on public Wi-Fi.

One module teaches you how to design a safer network.

One module shows how everyday devices (like cameras) become dangerous when misconfigured.

You can use them independently, but they’re strongest as a sequence:

See it → Understand it → Feel the risk → Practice decisions → Fix the system
