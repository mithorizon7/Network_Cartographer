Let's look carefully over this set of instructions and do a full audit of the current program and make a prioritized list of improvements and fixes and completions that we need to do:

Module 1: The Network Cartographer
What it is

The Network Cartographer is a visual map of a network that turns invisible relationships into something you can literally see.

Instead of learning networking as a list of definitions, you explore a network like a physical place.

In this module, the router is the “sun,” and every device is a “planet” orbiting it. Phones. Laptops. Smart TVs. Printers. Cameras. Speakers. Random IoT gadgets.

You click devices and the lab reveals what they are, what they’re connected to, and what risks they introduce.

What it teaches (in beginner language)

A network is devices + connections + rules

Your router is the hub that connects your private world to the public internet

Devices have two kinds of identity/addressing:

Local identity: how devices identify each other inside the local network

Network address: how things route data to the right place

You don’t need to memorize those terms yet. You’ll feel the difference by switching views.

The “wow” moment

People almost always underestimate what’s on a normal network. This module recreates that feeling safely with realistic “story networks”:

The family home network that has far more devices than anyone remembers.

The small business network where guest Wi-Fi and internal systems are mixed.

The hotel/public Wi-Fi environment with confusing network names.

Even though it’s fictional, it mirrors the reality that most networks are messier than we think.

The “healthy fear” moment

You’ll see “unknown” or “unfamiliar” devices appear in the network map—because that’s the truth of the modern world:

We buy devices that are computers in disguise.

We forget what we connected.

We assume “if it’s working, it must be safe.”

This module makes that assumption feel questionable.

What learners should walk away able to say

“I can explain what a router does.”

“I can explain why networks have multiple kinds of addresses.”

“I can describe what makes a device ‘risky’ on a network.”
