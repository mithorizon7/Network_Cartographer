App 1 — The Network Cartographer (Sandbox Visualizer)
Purpose

Help novices see what a network is: a router + many devices + relationships. Teach:

Private vs public networks

MAC vs IP as “local identity vs routable address”

NAT (private addresses inside, public presence outside)

The idea of layers (without requiring memorization)

Core UX concept

A “solar system” / orbit view:

Router is the sun

Devices orbit it in rings by zone (e.g., Main / Guest / IoT)

Clicking a device opens a side panel with “What this is” + “What to notice”

A big, persistent “Layer Goggles” control changes the labels and overlays

Critical UI requirements
A) Layout

Center canvas: network map

Left or top: scenario selector (Family IoT, Small Business, Hotel/Public)

Right panel: Device Details / Learning prompts

Bottom: Layer Goggles + mini-legend (what you’re currently viewing)

B) Layer Goggles (must-have)

A 4-mode toggle:

Link/Local view (MAC-world)
Show: fictional MAC-like identifiers (or “local IDs”) + “local delivery”

Network view (IP-world)
Show: private IP ranges; gateway; highlight routing boundary

Transport view (Ports/flows)
Show: “multiple flows at once” concept—web + video call + chat

Application view (HTTP/HTTPS)
Show: app protocols (web, email, streaming) and encryption status icons

Rules:

In Link/Local view, hide public internet concepts (no public IP).

In Network view, clearly show “private address space” and the router boundary.

In Transport view, don’t dump port numbers everywhere; show a few labeled flows.

In Application view, show “user-visible” actions (visit site, login, stream).

C) “Surprise” mechanics (sandbox-safe)

Each scenario should include:

1–2 devices with confusing names (“Generic Smart Controller”)

1 device flagged “Unknown” that triggers a prompt: “What would you do?”

A “Forgotten device” card (old tablet, guest phone) to teach real-world messiness
All of this is fictional.

D) Learning checks (lightweight, embedded)

Include 3–5 micro-prompts per scenario:

“Which of these is a private IP?”

“Which layer is responsible for routing?”

“Why do we need both MAC and IP in the same journey?”

Avoid long quizzes; keep it interactive.

Scenario data model (shared across apps)

Use a scenario JSON schema you can reuse everywhere. Keep it simple and auditable.

Notes:

Use RFC 5737 documentation IP ranges for public IP examples (e.g., 203.0.113.0/24) so you never use real routable addresses.

MAC/local IDs are fictional strings; do not imply they’re real OUIs.

Technical build requirements

Rendering: Canvas/WebGL preferred (PixiJS) for smoothness; SVG works for MVP but may lag with animations.

Layout: deterministic orbit layout (stable positions) + subtle motion; avoid chaotic “force graph” that confuses novices.

Accessibility: provide a list view alternative (“table view of devices”) for screen readers, and keyboard navigation for device selection.

State: keep all state in memory; allow “Reset scenario.”

Security/OPSEC posture

No analytics, no third-party scripts/fonts, no external calls.

Strict CSP: default-src 'self'; connect-src 'none'; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self'; script-src 'self'.

If hosted, minimize server logging; ideally deploy inside an approved environment.
