        "Investigate and possibly block it",
        "Unplug your router immediately"

    "iotIsolation": {
      "question": "Why are IoT devices (cameras, thermostats) often put on a separate network?",
      "answers": [
        "They need special internet settings",
        "They're often insecure and could be used to attack other devices",
        "They use too much bandwidth"
      ],
      "explanation": "Many IoT devices ship with weak security and infrequent updates. Isolation prevents a compromised device from reaching personal computers.",

      "question": "What type of IP address range is 10.0.x.x?",
      "answers": [
        "Public IP range",
        "Private IP range for internal networks",
        "Reserved for government use"
      ],
      "explanation": "10.0.0.0/8 is one of the RFC1918 private ranges, along with 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16. These addresses are not routed on the public internet.",
      "why": "Recognizing private ranges prevents you from assuming a device is publicly reachable.",
      "nextStep": "Treat 10.x addresses as internal and check the router for the public IP."

        "WPA3 provides stronger encryption for sensitive data",
        "There's no meaningful difference"
      ],
      "explanation": "WPA3 strengthens protection against offline password guessing and uses modern key exchange. Staff traffic should use the strongest available option.",
      "why": "Stronger Wi‑Fi encryption reduces the risk of credential exposure.",
      "nextStep": "Use WPA3 when available and keep WPA2 only for legacy devices."
    },

      "question": "Why is the printer flagged as a security risk?",
      "answers": [
        "Printers can't be secure",

        "It's connected to the wrong network"
      ],
      "explanation": "The printer still has default credentials. That allows unauthorized access to print jobs and can provide a foothold in the network.",
      "why": "Default credentials are a common entry point for attackers.",
      "nextStep": "Change the printer password and keep it on a restricted network."

        "Guest network is isolated from corporate network",
        "Customers don't have the password"
      ],
      "explanation": "Guest and corporate networks are separated by firewall rules. Guests can reach the internet but not internal servers.",

        "The network has no firewall",
        "The Wi-Fi signal is publicly visible"
      ],
      "explanation": "An open network has no link‑layer encryption. Anyone on the same Wi‑Fi can observe or modify traffic.",

      "explanation": "An attacker creates a rogue access point that mimics a legitimate SSID to capture traffic or credentials.",

    "publicPrivateIp": {
      "question": "On public Wi-Fi, why might your IP still be private (e.g., 172.16.x.x)?",
      "answers": [
        "Because the hotspot uses NAT and private addressing",
        "Because public Wi-Fi always gives out public IPs",
        "Because private IPs are only for home networks"
      ],
      "explanation": "Public hotspots often use private addressing with NAT. Your device gets a private IP; the hotspot shares one public IP.",
      "why": "Private IPs can exist in public places too; NAT hides many devices behind one public IP.",
      "nextStep": "Look for the NAT boundary: your device has a private IP and the hotspot has the public IP."

    "httpsImportance": {
      "question": "On public Wi-Fi, why is HTTPS especially important?",
      "answers": [
        "HTTPS makes websites load faster",
        "HTTPS encrypts your data so others on the network can't read it",
        "HTTPS prevents viruses"
      ],
      "explanation": "HTTPS encrypts the HTTP session between your browser and the server using TLS. Interceptors can see metadata but not the content.",
      "why": "HTTPS protects credentials and content on untrusted networks.",
      "nextStep": "Check for HTTPS (lock icon) before entering passwords or personal data."

    "vpn": {
      "question": "What does a VPN do on public Wi-Fi?",
      "answers": [
        "Makes your internet faster",
        "Creates an encrypted tunnel for all your traffic",
        "Blocks other users from connecting"
      ],
      "explanation": "A VPN encrypts and authenticates all traffic between your device and a VPN gateway, not just browser traffic.",
