      "explanation": "192.168.x.x addresses are private - they only work inside your home network. 8.8.8.8 is Google's public DNS, and 203.0.113.12 is your public IP (how the internet sees you).",
      "why": "Knowing private ranges helps you spot which devices are local and which are on the internet.",
      "nextStep": "When you see 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, or 172.16-31.x.x, treat it as local and find the public IP on your router."

      "question": "What is a MAC address (Local ID) used for?",
      "answers": ["Routing packets across the internet", "Identifying devices on the local network", "Encrypting your data"],
      "explanation": "MAC addresses are unique hardware identifiers burned into each network device. They're used for delivering data on your local network segment - like apartment numbers within a building. Routers strip MAC addresses when forwarding to the internet.",
      "why": "MACs identify devices only on your local network, not across the internet.",
      "nextStep": "Use your router's device list to match MAC addresses to real devices when troubleshooting."

    "guestNetwork": {
      "question": "Why would you put guests on a separate network?",
      "answers": ["To give them faster internet speed", "To prevent them from accessing your personal devices", "Because there's a limit to devices on one network"],
      "explanation": "Guest networks create isolation. Visitors can use the internet, but they can't see or access your personal computers, cameras, or smart devices.",

      "question": "You notice an unknown device on your network. What should you do?",
      "answers": ["Ignore it - it's probably fine", "Investigate and possibly block it", "Unplug your router immediately"],
      "explanation": "Unknown devices could be forgotten gadgets, neighbors leeching Wi-Fi, or even malicious actors. Check your router's admin page to identify and remove suspicious devices.",
      "why": "Unknown devices can indicate shared Wi-Fi abuse or a real intrusion.",
      "nextStep": "Identify it in your router and block it or change your Wi-Fi password."
    },
    "iotIsolation": {
      "question": "Why are IoT devices (cameras, thermostats) often put on a separate network?",
      "answers": ["They need special internet settings", "They're often insecure and could be used to attack other devices", "They use too much bandwidth"],
      "explanation": "Many IoT devices have weak security, use default passwords, or don't get updates. Isolating them prevents a compromised camera from spying on your laptop.",
      "why": "IoT devices are common entry points; isolation limits how far an attacker can move.",
      "nextStep": "Put IoT devices on a separate network or VLAN with limited access."

      "question": "What type of IP address range is 10.0.x.x?",
      "answers": ["Public IP range", "Private IP range for internal networks", "Reserved for government use"],
      "explanation": "10.0.0.0/8 is one of three private IP ranges (along with 172.16.x.x and 192.168.x.x). These addresses work only inside your network and can't be reached directly from the internet.",
      "why": "Recognizing private ranges prevents you from assuming a device is publicly reachable.",
      "nextStep": "Treat 10.x addresses as internal and look for the public IP on the router."

    "wpa3": {
      "question": "Why does the staff network use WPA3 while guest uses WPA2?",
      "answers": ["WPA3 is slower, only staff can handle it", "WPA3 provides stronger encryption for sensitive data", "There's no meaningful difference"],
      "explanation": "WPA3 offers better protection against password guessing attacks and uses newer encryption. Corporate data deserves the strongest protection available.",
      "why": "Stronger Wi-Fi encryption reduces the risk of password guessing and data exposure.",
      "nextStep": "Use WPA3 when available and keep WPA2 only for legacy devices."
    },
    "printerRisk": {
      "question": "Why is the printer flagged as a security risk?",
      "answers": ["Printers can't be secure", "It still has the default password, making it easy to hack", "It's connected to the wrong network"],
      "explanation": "Printers with default passwords are often targeted by attackers. They can be used to intercept documents, spread to other devices, or even become part of botnets.",
      "why": "Default credentials are a common entry point for attackers.",
      "nextStep": "Change default passwords and move printers to a restricted network."
    },
    "corpIsolation": {
      "question": "Why can't customers on guest Wi-Fi access the file server?",
      "answers": ["The file server is turned off", "Guest network is isolated from corporate network", "Customers don't have the password"],
      "explanation": "Network segmentation means different networks can't communicate. Guests get internet access but are completely walled off from internal resources.",
      "why": "Segmentation protects internal data even if guest Wi-Fi is compromised.",
      "nextStep": "Verify guest Wi-Fi cannot reach internal servers or printers."
    },
    "openWifi": {
      "question": "What does 'Open' network security mean?",
      "answers": ["Anyone can join without a password", "The network has no firewall", "The Wi-Fi signal is publicly visible"],
      "explanation": "Open networks have no encryption. This means anyone nearby can potentially see your traffic - it's like sending postcards instead of sealed letters.",
      "why": "Open Wi-Fi lets nearby users observe traffic, which increases risk for sensitive data.",
      "nextStep": "Avoid sensitive logins on open Wi-Fi or use a VPN."
    },
    "evilTwin": {
      "question": "What is an 'evil twin' attack?",
      "answers": ["When someone clones your device", "A fake Wi-Fi network that mimics a legitimate one", "When two routers interfere with each other"],
      "explanation": "Attackers set up fake access points with names like 'Hotel_Free_WiFi' to lure victims. When you connect, they can see everything you do.",
      "why": "Fake SSIDs can capture your traffic and steal credentials.",
      "nextStep": "Verify the official SSID with staff and turn off auto-join for public Wi-Fi."
    },
    "publicPrivateIp": {
      "question": "On public Wi-Fi, why might your IP still be private (e.g., 172.16.x.x)?",
      "answers": ["Because the hotspot uses NAT and private addressing", "Because public Wi-Fi always gives out public IPs", "Because private IPs are only for home networks"],
      "explanation": "Public Wi-Fi often uses private IP ranges and NAT. Your device has a private address locally, while the hotspot uses one public IP to reach the internet.",
      "why": "Private IPs can exist in public places too; NAT hides many devices behind one public IP.",
      "nextStep": "Look for the NAT boundary: your device has a private IP and the hotspot has the public IP."
    },
    "httpsImportance": {
      "question": "On public Wi-Fi, why is HTTPS especially important?",
      "answers": ["HTTPS makes websites load faster", "HTTPS encrypts your data so others on the network can't read it", "HTTPS prevents viruses"],
      "explanation": "HTTPS uses TLS encryption to create a secure tunnel between you and the website. Even if someone captures your traffic, they see encrypted data instead of your passwords and personal information.",

      "answers": ["Makes your internet faster", "Creates an encrypted tunnel for all your traffic", "Blocks other users from connecting"],
      "explanation": "A VPN encrypts everything leaving your device, not just web traffic. It's like putting all your postcards in a locked box before sending them.",
      "why": "A VPN protects all apps, not just browsers, on untrusted networks.",

      "question": "What should you avoid doing on public Wi-Fi?",

      "explanation": "Sensitive activities like banking should wait for a secure network or require a VPN. Even HTTPS can't protect against all attacks on compromised networks.",
